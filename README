dwm - dynamic window manager
============================
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.

to install enter the directory and type:
sudo make install

for use with display manager create a file: "/usr/share/xsessions/dwm.desktop" containing

    [Desktop Entry]
    Encoding=UTF-8
    Name=dwm
    Comment=Dynamic window manager
    Exec=dwm
    Icon=dwm
    Type=XSession
   
it will then appear in your display manager

I need to make a slstatus / dwm blocks :/
